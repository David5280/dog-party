# dog-party
This is my first solo project at the Turing school.  Phase one of the project was to create a webpage based off the static comp seen below by using clean HTML and CSS. Phase two of the project had two parts.  The first was to use Javascript to add interactivity to the site using the input box, the submit button, and a section of an h2 element.  The second was to make the site responsive so that it looks polished on any device.
